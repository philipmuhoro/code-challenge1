## Description
I created functions to solve the following problems;
###
-**Student Grade Generator** Generates student marks between 0 and 100 and matches the output to the corresponding grade with __A__>79, __B__-60 to 79, __C__-59 to 49, __D__-40 to 49, __E__-<40.
###
-**Speed Detector** Takes the speed of a car as input. Speeds of less than __70km/s__ return __"OK"__. Else for every _5km/s_above __70km/s__ **One** demerit point is printed and prints the total number of demerit points. If a driver gets **more than 12 points**the function prints out **"Linense suspended"**
###
-**Net Salary Calculator** This a program tasked with calculating an individual's __Net Salary__ by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It also calculates the __Payee__(Tax), __NHIF__ and __NSSF__ deductions, __Gross__ and __Net__ Salary.
